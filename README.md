# Demographics are Destiny

_Analysis of Global Demographics_

**Motivation**: I'm deeply interested in understanding the future, and seeing what's coming.
Few areas of analysis are as predictive and close to deterministic as demographics.

## Aspects of demographic analysis:

**Data:**
* "working age" is defined by lower limit, upper limit
* age data is list of population size male, female
* replacement rate is constant: 2.1
* fertility rate is time series of x.y
* relevant summary stats include: 
** % working age supporting young ones
** % working age supporting above working age
